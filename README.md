This is a simple library management system designed to manage books within a library.

## Getting Started

To Get started with the library management system you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/balgopal/nextjs-tutorial.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
`cd library-management-system`

3. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

4. Run the development server:
`npm run dev`

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the application.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can use the library management system to perform various tasks such as:

- Removing a book from the library
- Searching for a book by title
- Displaying a list of all books in the library
- Calculating the total number of books in the library
